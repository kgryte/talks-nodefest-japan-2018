# Real-Time Machine Learning in JavaScript

> Talk for [Node Festival Japan (2018)][nodefest-japan-2018].


## Abstract

Real-time machine learning is a collection of statistical methods to obtain insights from continuous data streams. In this talk, I'll provide an overview of real-time machine learning algorithms and discuss how these algorithms can be implemented and used in JavaScript. I'll highlight why running these algorithms in JavaScript has several advantages compared to languages traditionally used for numerical computing, including the ability to perform client-side computations. I'll conclude by discussing best-practices and common pitfalls encountered when using machine learning algorithms within JavaScript environments.
