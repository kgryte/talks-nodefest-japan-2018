				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Machine Learning</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						Machine learning is applied mathematics and statistics and largely resides in the domain of computer science.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the field of statistics, we focus on mathematical formulas, the derivation of robust estimators, and developing mathematical techniques for modeling problem domains.
					</p>
					<p>
						In computer science, we focus less on mathematical purity and more on the practical aspects of writing algorithms which can run efficiently and with high performance and give us results which are "good enough".
					</p>
					<p>
						The primary aim of machine learning is to find patterns in data, to find the proverbial signal in the noise.
					</p>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Models</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						To describe those patterns we want to find, we <em>formulate</em> and <em>train</em> <strong>models</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						A model is a mathematical formulation summarizing the nature of, and describing the relationship between, data variables.
					</p>
					<p>
						Models serve as the statistical foundation for machine learning.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order for machine learning algorithms to find patterns in data, we must "train" (or "teach") machine learning algorithms as to what those patterns are.
					</p>
					<p>
						In a sense, machine learning algorithms "learn" the models used to describe particular patterns. That learning often comes in the form of learning specific values of coefficients within an equation.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an example...

				<h2 class="no-text-transform">What will be the temperature tomorrow?</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<p class="fragment column column-4" style="padding-top: 0.9em">
						$$t_n = t_{n-1}$$
					</p>
					<p class="fragment column column-4">
						$$t_n = \frac{1}{7} \sum_{i=n-7}^{n-1} t_i$$
					</p>
					<p class="fragment column column-4">
						$$t_n = \frac{1}{W} \sum_{i=n-W}^{n-1} t_i$$
					</p>
				</div>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						...suppose we want to "predict" the temperature tomorrow. A naive approach we could use would be to predict that the temperature tomorrow is whatever the temperature is today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our naive approach can be expressed mathematically as t_n = t_{n-1}, which is a way of saying that, for a given day n, the temperature should equal the temperature of the previous day. This equation is our model.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, we might, perhaps rightly, believe that this naive approach might not be as accurate as we would like due to day-to-day temperature variability (i.e., noise).
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, an anomalous weather pattern may lead to a very warm day followed by a very cold day.
					</p>
					<p>
						So, one possible refinement would be to predict that the temperature tomorrow is the average temperature of the past 7 days.
					</p>
					<p>
						By taking the average, we will "smooth" out some of the day-to-day variability and hopefully have a more reliable estimate over the long term.
					</p>
					<p>
						In other words, by using the average temperature of the previous 7 days to predict tomorrow's temperature, our predictions will be closer (i.e., have a smaller <strong>error</strong>), on average, to the actual temperature than had we used our naive model.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can parameterize our model with the variable W which represents the number of days we want to average over.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this example, the "model" is the mathematical formula describing the computation of the average temperature. That model is "trained" by giving the model data (e.g., the temperature for each of the past 7 days). In this case, the output of the trained model is a single value, which we then use to "predict" tomorrow's temperature.

				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Training Algorithms</h2>

				<div class="row">
					<ul class="column column-12">
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Batch</strong>: build a model from a "batch" of data</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Incremental</strong>: continuously update a model as data arrives</li>
						<li class="fragment"><strong>Mini-batch</strong>: hybrid of batch and incremental training.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						How we train machine learning algorithms comes in two varieties.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first is "batch". Batch training means training a model over an entire dataset. In order to accommodate new data, we must re-train our model by performing batch training over the entire updated data set.
					</p>
					<p>
						Many "big data"/map-reduce style algorithms (e.g., such as those run on Hadoop) are of this variety.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second is "incremental". Incremental training means training a model incrementally, one datum at a time. Such an approach allows one to continuously update a model as data arrives, without having to re-train over the entire data set.
					</p>
					<p>
						I should mention in passing that a third "variety" exists, commonly referred to as <strong>mini-batch</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mini-batch is a hybrid of batch and incremental. In this variety, we buffer data and train models in small batches. The primary motivation for mini-batch is the ability to achieve some of the robustness of batch training with a reasonably close approximation of the immediacy of incremental training (i.e., mini-batch can achieve "near real-time").

				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Real-Time Machine Learning</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						This brings us to real-time machine learning.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the purposes of this talk, I define real-time machine learning as the subset of machine learning algorithms which support incremental training. I.e., as a new datum arrives, I can update my model incrementally. Meaning, in order to generate a new prediction, I don't need to <strong>store</strong> and analyze <strong>all</strong> past prior events.
					</p>
					<p>
						Commonly, perhaps due to marketing "speak", you'll see machine learning approaches and technologies labeled as "real-time". These approaches are more accurately described as "near real-time", in which, due to distributed computing strategies and/or parallelization, they allow for re-training and analysis to be done more quickly than traditional batch analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						My definition excludes these near real-time approaches.
					</p>
					<p>
						This talk's focus is how we can develop, and use, incremental training machine learning methods in JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why this limited definition? Because I find incremental machine learning algorithms particularly compelling in JavaScript.
					</p>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Why incremental algorithms?</h2>

				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Privacy</li>
					<li class="fragment">Low latency</li>
					<li class="fragment">Offline</li>
					<li class="fragment">Power efficient</li>
					<li class="fragment">Direct access to sensor data</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						First, why are incremental algorithms exciting?
					</p>
					<p>
						Incremental machine learning algorithms allow for model training and prediction to happen concurrently. I don't need to separate these two aspects: training and prediction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why is this important? For the following reasons...
					</p>
					<p>
						Privacy. Incremental machine learning algorithms allow data to stay on-device. For example, the Apple Watch has an API which allows you to access heart beat data. With incremental machine learning, I can train a model (i.e., learn a user's "normal" heart beat pattern) and then detect when a heart beat, or set of heart beats, no longer fits this pattern. In this scenario, I never have to send this data to remote servers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because I don't have to send data to remote servers, analysis has low latency, works offline, and can be more power efficient.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, as analysis can occur on-device (or using newer buzzword terminology, at the "edge"), we have direct access to all device sensor data, which removes the need for often complex device data serialization and de-serialization logic.
					</p>

			<section class="center">
				<aside class="notes">
					To help motivate real-time machine learning use cases, let us consider some real-world data streams...
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Example Data Streams</h2>

				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Mouse/cursor movements</li>
					<li class="fragment">Scrolling</li>
					<li class="fragment">Clicks</li>
					<li class="fragment">Sensors</li>
					<li class="fragment">Monitoring</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						In JavaScript environments, such as the web browser, we have data streams such as mouse and cursor movements, scrolling, and "clicks".
					</p>
					<p>
						In the web browser, on mobile devices, and in Node.js, we have access to sensor data, such as device orientation, temperature, and ambient lighting; all data which is being continuously recorded.
					</p>
					<p>
						And finally, we have monitoring data, such as logs of failed HTTP/S requests, server errors, et cetera.
					</p>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Use Cases</h2>

				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Forecasting</li>
					<li class="fragment">Anomalies</li>
					<li class="fragment">Clustering</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						What can real-time machine learning allow you to do?
					</p>
					<p>
						We have already discussed one use case: forecasting (prediction). The naive model we formulated earlier which involved computing an average in order to forecast tomorrow's temperature can be formulated as an incremental algorithm.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each day we can record the temperature, use that temperature to update our model, and make a forecast for the next day based on our updated model.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the UI interaction data we discussed in the previous slide, such as cursor movement and scrolling, we can generate a prediction as to what resource a user will most likely need next, allowing us to create what would feel like a faster and more responsive UI.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, a simple task could be to track cursor movement and, based on (x,y) coordinates over time, train a model to predict which button a user will click next, causing the desired resource to be fetched before a user actually clicks the button, thus leading to a more instantaneous experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another classic use case is anomaly detection, such as detecting a malfunctioning system or credit card fraud. In this classification task, we want to detect when a datum, or set of datums, is different than the rest.
					</p>
					<p>
						The sooner you are able to classify new data as "anomalous", the sooner you can fix a potential problem.
					</p>
					<p>
						A third use case is clustering, which is the process of assigning groups.
					</p>
					<p>
						As an example, we could collect device performance metrics, such as CPU utilization and memory usage, and identify different application "states", such as resource intensive, idle, et cetera.
					</p>
					<p>
						The number of states and how frequently they are occupied could be informative for resource planning and optimization.
					</p>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Why JavaScript?</h2>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						At this point, I may have convinced you that real-time machine learning sounds useful, but why do any of this in JavaScript? Don't other languages exist which are better suited to the task?
					</p>
					<p>
						As a practitioner who has written and used machine learning algorithms in other languages, I can confidently say that JavaScript is as equally qualified as any of those other languages, such as R and Python, for machine learning tasks.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, the stigma that JavaScript is <strong>not</strong> suitable for math (and, by association, machine learning) persists, so I would like to take a moment to dispel a couple of myths...
					</p>
				</aside>
			</section>

			<section class="center">
				<h2 class="no-text-transform">Myths</h2>

				<ul>
					<li class="fragment">Performance</li>
					<li class="fragment">Incompatibility</li>
				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						The first myth is poor performance. We have run the benchmarks. You can run them yourself. JavaScript environments are just as fast as, and more often than not, faster than Python and easily faster than R.
					</p>
					<p>
						Modern JavaScript environments are highly optimized and continually improving. With WebAssembly and Node.js native add-ons, achieving near-native speed in JavaScript environments is readily achievable.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second myth is that JavaScript is somehow incompatible with mathematical computation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The argument in support of this myth typically goes something like single-threaded, something, something, floating-point, something, something, 64-bit integers.
					</p>
					<p>
						What is clear about the people making this argument is that they have not used other languages for scientific computing and machine learning.
					</p>
					<p>
						People can, and, more importantly, <strong>do</strong> write robust and performant mathematical code in JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						Personally, I can point to stdlib and the fact that we've implemented literally thousands of mathematical functions in JavaScript and have not encountered any overwhelming issues due to the language itself.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yes, some languages have syntactical features more amenable to terser code (e.g., operator overloading), but the lack of these features does not preclude math algorithms from being implemented.
					</p>
					<p>
						In fact, e.g., C suffers from similar operator overloading limitations and no one who believes the "JavaScript cannot do math" myth seems to believe the same about C.
					</p>
					<p>
						In short, many of those who say math cannot be done in JavaScript seem to have various preconceptions which are not grounded in reality and most likely have never written mathematical libraries.
					</p>
					<p>
						The <strong>primary</strong> reason why people do not currently do mathematical computation in JavaScript is that other ecosystems already have a critical mass of libraries and frameworks for doing mathematical computation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The issue is not one of technical limitations, but one of community support--a problem that myself and colleagues are working to address.

						To help structure the example, I've prepared an interactive Observable notebook which steps through an analysis of network sensor data.

					<ul>

				</ul>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>
						So...tips and tricks. The following tips are generally applicable regardless of whether a machine learning algorithm is written and used in JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first tip is to use <strong>simulation</strong> to generate synthetic datasets to run against real-time machine learning algorithms so you better understand an algorithm's capabilities and limitations.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, <strong>always</strong>, <strong>always</strong>, <strong>always</strong> perform exploratory data analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means exploring your data by plotting and performing basic analyses in order to get a "feel" for your data and to test any basic assumptions (e.g., as we did when testing that the network sensor data is normally distributed).
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, while true in general, but especially for real-time machine learning, what makes algorithms performant are two things.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first is using the right data structure.
					</p>
					<p>
						One such data structure is n-dimensional arrays (ndarrays), which are single-segment contiguous blocks of memory. These data structures allow for more efficient cache optimization.
					</p>
					<p>
						Another common data structure is a circular buffer. While the textbook definition is simple, these need to be implemented carefully in order to avoid poor memory management, especially when implementing them in JavaScript.
					</p>
					<p>
						Certain real-time algorithms require specialized tree data structures, such as quantile approximation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The second is using the right algorithm.
					</p>
					<p>
						One example where using the right algorithm is critical is quantile approximation. A naive approach would require storing all data in memory and sorting the data each time a new data arrives.
					</p>
					<p>
						A better approach is use an approximate method which uses a tree data structure and an acceptable error rate.
					</p>
					<p>
						In batch analysis, especially for one-off analyses, we can be okay using naive algorithms or less efficient data structures; however, in the context of real-time statistical analysis and machine learning within web and Node.js server applications, this is not viable.
